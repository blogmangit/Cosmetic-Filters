# Cosmetic-Filters

Some custom cosmetic filters to be used for ublock origin & adguard. This filter is mainly for mobile browsing specifically for heavily modified amp pages.

Beware that this filter is very aggressive filters which disables the following from an webpage and is very effective if used with ublock origin and adguard. This filter blocks the following: 

1. next section from any webpage. 
2. empty spaces
3. unnecessary buttons, widgets, banners etc

But I can assure you onething that it does not block the main content of the webpage also not any audio or video contents related to it. Basically it renders the main article in complete reader mode but does not skip any audio, video, comments, related posts section of the main article.

Any feedback is very much appreciated from your part also you can report anything in the issue section & I will definitely add it to the filter. 

Regards.
